# In this exercise, let's try to create a function that calculate the area of a triangle
# Formula for calculating area of triangle: Area = (base * height)/2

# Step 1: Create a function that takes 2 parameters - base and height
def calculateTriangleArea(base, height):
    return (base * height)/2


# Step 2: Call the triangle area function to calculate the area of a triangle with base of 7 and height of 4
# Store the result in a variable named `area`
area = calculateTriangleArea(7, 4)


# Step 3: Print out the area
print(area)
