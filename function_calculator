# Practice time
# Step 1: Create a function that would always divide the inputNumber by 5 and return the answer
def divideBy5(inputNumber):
    return inputNumber/5


# Step 2: Call the function with input value of 100 and store the calculation result in a variable named `answer`
answer = divideBy5(100)


# Step 3: Print out the value of `answer`
print(answer)
